# Manual DICO Integration
This document describes how the DICO Integration app can be used to send and receive electronic order documents in Business central to and from your vendors.

## Introduction

The DICO standard is a set of rules for electronically exchanged information between manufacturers, maintenance- and installation companies et cetera. Using these rules, the documents can safely be exchanged, such as invoices, price lists, orders and packing documents. This connection is fully integrated within Business Central and can be accessed through the Extension Marketplace.
